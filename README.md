Application overview
My first project was about showing info about "popular manga". 
The way I consume media like tvs shows etc. is I want to watch something I think I'll like so I tend to do research and look at descriptions to see if I'd like the show I'm thinking about watching. Though when someone asks, hey have you seen anything good lately, you're probably not going to go through every show in your head like an array and pick the one that matches what you're looking for. Wouldn't it be convenient to have a list of things you've watched and just show that to whoever asks. How this relates to manga? It's a type of entertainment just like books and that will be an option when creating a review. I'm comparing the project I'm making to something like a website called my-anime-list but my project will clearly be a lot more basic.
