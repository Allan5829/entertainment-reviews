# EntertainmentReviews

This app follows a similar theme to my Mod 1 project, which was manga. I use a website called my anime list to keep track of what anime I've watched or want to watch and one of the features on the website is giving reviews. This app lets users create reviews as a way of keeping track or just giving a regular review. I used entertainment in the title because it's meant as a catch-all term for books (or manga), movies, and tv shows (or anime).
